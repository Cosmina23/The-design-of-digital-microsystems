Microsystem with the 8086 microprocessor

Design a microsystem with the following structure:
- Central unit with the 8086 microprocessor;
- 128 KB EPROM memory, using 27C512 circuits;
- 64 KB SRAM memory, using 62256 circuits;
- Serial interface, with the 8251 circuit, placed in the area 0650H – 0652H or 0E50H – 0E52H, depending on the position of the S1 microswitch;
- Parallel interface, with the 8255 circuit, placed in the area 0260H – 0266H or 0360H – 0366H, depending on the position of the S2 microswitch;
- A 9-contact mini keyboard;
- 24 LEDs;
- A 7-segment display module with 6 rows (up to 6 hexadecimal characters can be displayed simultaneously).
- An LCD module, with 2 lines of 16 characters each, with an interface chosen by the student.
